Q: What are Git and GitHub?
A: Git is the tool you use to manage your work locally (like your pen and notebook).
GitHub is the hub where you share that work and collaborate with others (like a library or a shared office).

Q: Why they are used?
A: Think of Git as your personal "time machine" for your work, it’s a tool on your computer that saves every version of your project so you can undo mistakes or try crazy ideas without ruining anything.
GitHub is like the "social media" or "cloud" where you upload those saves. It lets you share your work with the world, back it up safely, and collaborate with other people without accidentally overwriting each other’s stuff.
Basically: Git is how you keep your work organized; GitHub is where you put it so others can see it.

Q: Basic Git workflow
A: The basic Git workflow is just a simple three-step loop. Think of it like taking a photo, putting it in a frame, and then hanging it on a gallery wall.

Q: How GitHub helps in team collaboration?
A: In a team, GitHub acts like a smart project manager that keeps everyone from crashing into each other. Without it, you’d be emailing zip files back and forth like it's 1995.
GitHub provides Single Source of Truth. Whether you are a designer looking at assets, a manager checking project velocity, or a dev writing code, everyone is looking at the same real-time data.
GitHub has essentially become the digital "town square" for developers. It’s less about just hosting code and more about creating a transparent, organized workflow where everyone knows who is doing what, why, and when.
